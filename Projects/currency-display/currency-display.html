        <h2>What is This Project About?</h2>
        <p>
                This is a hardware design that can display the real-time currency between CNY or CNH and USD on a segment display.

        <h2>Why I Build This Project?</h2>
        <p>
                At the time I built this project, the currency between the Chinese Yuan and the U.S. Dollar fluctuated dramatically. I think a display on my desk that displays the real-time currency can help me decide when to buy some dollars.

        <h2>What Problems Did I Resolve in the Project?</h2>
        <h3>HTTPs Request</h3>
        <p>
                The API I chose to retrieve the currency information can only be requested using HTTPS. While handling HTTPS request is as simple as HTTP request on Linux and Windows. Using a microcontroller to post an HTTPS request is not an easy task. Fortunately, ESP32 provides some libraries to handle HTTPS requests, but I also need to configure the certifications.

        <h2>How I Improved from This Project?</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Learned how to program a ESP32 microcontroller</li>
                <li>Improved my ability to design, manufacture, and soldering a PCB</li>
                <li>Acquired the knowledge of HTTPS</li>
        </ul>
