        <h2>What is This Project About?</h2>
        <p>
                This is a language designed for one of my classes, EE414, when I was an undergraduate student. In that class, we are required to write a lot of assembly instructions manually. Initially, I explored using 'gcc' for C language to help me write assembly instructions, but that was not a solution because of the incomplete alignment between the course's instruction set and the full RISC-V set. So, I conceived Language 414 as. Although Language 414 is extremely simple, dropping features such as functions, for loops, and string support, it simplifies the process of writing assembly instructions considerably.
