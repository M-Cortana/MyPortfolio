        <p>
                This app is designed to simulate the distribution and intensity of electric fields produced by a phase-controlled array, as shown in the figure above.

        <h2>What Problems Did I Resolve in the Project?</h2>
        <h3>Design and Implement the Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
                The whole image consists of pixels. To calculate the electric field strength of each pixel, the phasor method is used to calculate the sum of signals from each antenna unit.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Multithreading</h3>
        <p>
                The biggest problem with multithreading is that multiple threads can interfere with each other when they are trying to access the same memory location at the same time. To avoid this problem, I divided the image into 32 areas, and each thread is responsible for one area. Also, dispatch groups are used to prevent any potential interference.
